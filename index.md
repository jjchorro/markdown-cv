## Personal skills

__Foreign languages__
All days I read and write emails on English, so my level is fluent. I am improving every time speaking level with teammates.

__Teamwork__
I have worked in teams with about 30 people from different countries with different time zones and
there has always been great communication. Also we do pair programmings with teammates almost every day
and with people from other teams twice a week to increase our business knowledge and skills.

__Manage time and deadlines__
Every task I have assigned to perform is rated by the whole team to be done in an estimated 
time and with an estimated difficulty. The experience has taught me to manage my time and
tasks when the workload is higher but without forgetting organization and documentation.

__Organization tasks__
Given an acceptance criteria by business, we begin develop on TDD with QA teammates. 
At first, we talk about tests, then QA creates tests and it will fail, so we will make it work with our code development.
